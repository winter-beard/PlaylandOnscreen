A map of the character paths of films and TV episodes shot at Rye, Playland. 
Findings: Woody Allen is weirdly obsessed with amusement parks and characters with monotonous lives within them, the way movies are shot at Playland makes no sense with layout of park, movie characters do not know what the best rides are.

Data collection: Hand drawn paths based off watching movies and tv shows and knowing park really well.

Things I learned: HTML style coding for embedded rectangles, images, scrolly elements, basically lots of this, FigJam, Mapbox, Javascript scripting for interactivity, scrolly coding for a Mapbox entity, removing backgrounds and creating image from the collage. 

Things I failed at: getting graphic.svg to show up on website, having a fixed entity and then scrolly elements beneath it, getting each geojson route to animate as a single layer for each scroll then disappearing, getting sprite to animate on path, getting symbol to animate on path, getting static symbol to appear every few meters on path. Will continue working on this as part of mapping project. Illustrator photoshopping. AI2html.

I also wanted to include a gallery of images for each movie but ran out of time, major copyright issues.
