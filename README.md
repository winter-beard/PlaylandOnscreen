I spent my 30th birthday at Rye, Playland, an aging relic of time that feels so far away to occupy it is surreal, I arrived 15 minutes before it closed, got a ticket that was $20 cheaper because I was a resident. It is the place my grandparents went on their honeymoon, and a boardwalk I have walked my whole childhood, tracing its exterior in the unrelenting heat of summer by bike, and by foot in the dead of winter, usually with a small fluffy dog swaggering and unleashed, leaving me in his dust.  In watching all of the films and television shows that have captured scenes at this place and then looking at archival footage of Playland in the 1930s and 1940s it is confronting to see it in every instance so devoid of people of color. The town I grew up in has always been full of the whitest spaces I have every been. I was steeped in this racial makeup for nearly 20 years. Yet Playland in the summer was always was this place that was full of bright lights, whirring and clacking and full of people from outside my small white world, families or friends that travelled up from the bouroughs for some adrenaline or a beach to lie on. 

My initial impulse was to animate the paths of movie characters milling around the park to upskill on D3, ideally i would have created little character-shaped sprites but that proved too difficult.


When I received feedback that this lacked a story punch - I agreed, and so going forward I have requested several records from the local Parks Department on its ownership change in the 1980s to the Marriot Corporation - it was right after this and under Marriott's ownership that the park became a bigger movie destination. I have requested film licenses to see if there is any detail on the price they set and their Budgets to see if allowing filming made much difference to their bottom line that year. Once I have this I will further develop the story. I have also sought data on the attendees of Playland who all give their zip code when arriving and I thought it could make and interesting map to see where people visiting come from, and whether residents even visit it in a significant way. 

Data collection: Hand drawn paths based off watching movies and tv shows and knowing park really well.

Things I learned: scrolly elements, Mapbox, Javascript scripting for interactivity, scrolly coding for a Mapbox entity, Illustrator photoshopping. AI2html.

Things I struggled with: Getting HTML to work alongside a fixed asset, and scrollytelling working with fixe objects, getting each geojson routes to animate, getting sprite to animate on path, getting symbol to animate on path, getting static symbol to appear every few meters on path. Will continue working on this as part of mapping project. 

I also wanted to include a gallery of images for each movie but ran out of time, major copyright issues. Still seeking approval for use of archival pictures.
