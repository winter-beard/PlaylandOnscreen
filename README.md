# PlaylandOnscreen
A map of the character paths of films and TV episodes shot at Rye, Playland. 


Things I learned: HTML style coding for embedded rectangles, images, scrolly elements, basically lots of this, FigJam, Mapbox, Javascript scripting for interactivity, scrolly coding for a Mapbox entity, removing backgrounds and creating image from the collage. 

Things I failed at: getting graphic.svg to show up on website, having a fixed entity and then scrolly elements beneath it, getting each geojson route to animate as a single layer for each scroll then disappearing, getting sprite to animate on path, getting symbol to animate on path, getting static symbol to appear every few meters on path. Will continue working on this as part of mapping project. Illustrator photoshopping. AI2html.

Please look at graphic.svg I could not get it onto website and it really would have made webpage better.
